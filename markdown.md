Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is one of the best JRPG of the Nintendo Switch, taking the best elements from the previous games of the Xeno Saga
it offers a great plot, amazing characters, good inprovement in the battle system and some of the most emotional moments
that I experienced in videogames.

The plot takes place in Aionios, a world where the people of two nations -Keves and Agnus- live perpetually in war, the people of both nations
only have a lifespan of 10 years, and in order to live that extend of time, they need to take lifes from the other nation, because they 
have flame clocks, that represent the life energy of each individual, therefore they are forced to steal the life force from the enemies.

"Fighting in order to live... and living to fight. That's the way of our world."
