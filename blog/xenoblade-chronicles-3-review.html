it offers a great plot, amazing characters, good improvement in the battle system, and some of the most emotional moments
that I experienced in video games.</p>
<!-- --><p>The plot takes place in Aionios, a world where the people of two nations -Keves and Agnus- live perpetually in war, they only have a lifespan of 10 years, and in order to live that extent of time, they need to take life from the other nation, because they have flame clocks, that represent the life energy of each individual, therefore they are forced to steal the life force from the enemies.</p>
<!-- --><p><em>Fighting in order to live... and living to fight. That&#x27;s the way of our world.</em></p>
<!-- --><h2>Characters</h2>
<!-- --><p>In order to talk about this Xenoblade game, I need to detail about the characters, because they are the core part of the game.</p>
<!-- --><p>We will play as Noah, Lanz, and Eunie from Keves, and Mio, Taion, and Sena from Agnus,  in this game all of them have enough protagonism and character growth as the plot goes on, another thing to point is that you will also be able to use the 6 members in the battles, and you&#x27;ll also be able to switch freely in the middle of the battle to any of them that you want to control.
The core mechanic of this game is that each character can fusion with another to control an Ouroboros, which is like a mecha similar to one of their previous games from PS1, Xenogears, you can use the Ouroboros forms for a small span of time in the middle of battles to deal a great amount of damage to the enemies using their skills.</p>
<!-- --><p>But is also used as a plot device, because when the characters are merged, they share their memories and past experiences, and thanks to that the characters start to realize that all of them are very similar, they have friends, traumas, hobbies, etc. So we can experience the war from each character&#x27;s perspective.</p>
<!-- --><p>Another important point is that Noah and Mio are offseers so they have the duty to play flutes to send off the spirits of those who have died in the battle between Keves and Agnus, therefore the flutes are of the most important things in the world-building, the soundtrack of the game includes flutes tones, and sometimes the characters will need to serve their duties after combats.
Even the developers went so far as they made custom flutes in the real world, Mitsuda-san said, &quot;By making the flutes from scratch, you can create a sound that hasn&#x27;t been heard before.&quot; <!-- --><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-6-xenoblade-chronicles-3-part-2/" title="Nintendo Interview">Nintendo Interview</a></p>

<!-- --><h2>Gameplay</h2>
<!-- --><p>The battle system is a mix between Xenoblade 1 and Xenoblade 2 but it&#x27;s extended with the class system, each character has their own class but you can assign different character classes, for example, Eunie&#x27;s a healer but you can assign her a fighter class if you want her to do the damage in the battles, As a result, you can create your own classes combinations.</p>
<!-- --><p>Another feature is the Hero system, there are side characters that you can recruit and use as a 1 extra character in battles, however, you can&#x27;t play as them ( They are controlled by the IA), they serve as the support role for the team, and you can also assign the heroes classes to the protagonists, therefore giving more freedom.</p>
<!-- --><p>As I said before, another feature in battles is the ouroboros mechanic, you can merge two characters in one mecha in the middle of the battles to use their skills for a small span of time, but the class system doesn&#x27;t affect the ouroboros skills, as a result, you can use the mecha as a way to use the original class of each character.</p>
<!-- --><p>Another feature in the battles is the Chain attack, in combat, there is a circular bar that is filling, when charged you can activate the chain attack, in this part of the battle, the enemy won&#x27;t attack you, and you can execute combos based on your character classes, giving you an opportunity to turn the fight to your favor.</p>

<!-- --><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- --><p>Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is an amazing game, a big step from the previous game of the franchise, giving huge improvements to the series, like the Class system, the sidequests, the serious tone of the plot, the graphics, the resolution in the Switch handled mode, and being able to control 6 characters in battles. it&#x27;s not a perfect game because it has some flaws, and other small problems because of the Switch Hardware but Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is a love letter to the JRPG&#x27;s fans.</p>
