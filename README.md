This is my personal portfolio developed using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and hosted in [My website](https://salascarlos.com).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deployment
There is a Github action pipeline to automate the Next building and deployment to Github Pages. 

You only need to push somes changes to the main branch in order to use it.
