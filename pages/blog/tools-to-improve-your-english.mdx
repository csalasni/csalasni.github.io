Hi, In this post I'd like to recommend a different set of tools that I've found useful over the last months which can be used as an extra tool to improve, measure, and help with your English progress! These tools have been very important in my learning journey.

## English Tests

I've used different tests online to test my English level, but I've found that these two are the best ones available, furthermore they give you an English Certification which you can show on your profile or on Linkedin, which is great!

Having a reliable source to test your level is important because you can track your learning progress over time, and see your improvements, because the most important thing in this journey is to never give up and sometimes it's a bit frustrating when you don't see an improvement.

## Grammar
For grammar the best tool that I've found was [Busuu](https://www.busuu.com/dashboard) , it's an application like Duolingo but it follows the CEFR, therefore you get lessons according to your current level, for example you'll learn about Reported Speech if you reach the B2 Level.

The only problem which I've found was that you need to invest on their subscription plan to use the mobile app, but you can use the Desktop version which allows you to review the lessons if you watch an AD before.

I also would like to suggest to write something on a daily basis like a Dairy journal, to practice your grammar skills, You can use [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) or [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) which are very great and easy to use.

## Listening

In listening you have the entire Internet as your disposal, you can use Youtube, Netflix to watch different series with subtitles on to practice your listening skills, because it takes a while to master this skill. You can also watch news from English Countries, I'd suggest this channel because they stream their news 24/7 on Youtube for free [ABC News](https://www.youtube.com/@ABCNews) , you can also watch streams on Twitch in case you are intestered on Gaming, however, it's harder because you don't have subtitles.

I also would like to suggest these videos of [BBC Learning English](https://www.youtube.com/@bbclearningenglish) , they offer a lot of different lessons to practice your listening skills while also learning new vocabulary about different topics.

## Speaking

Speaking is without a doubt the most difficult part of learning a language, specially because it's hard to practice it when you aren't living in an English country. 

I'd suggest you to try to talk with a friend or relative from one of these countries, and talk with him a bit, however, if you don't know someone that already knows the language, then you can try to find a Discord Server about a topic that you like, for example if you like to play Valorant, you could try to find a premade Team to play with, because this game uses the microphone heavily to communicate and make strats, it's a good way to have fun, meet peers, and also practice your speaking skills.

There are also other Discord servers where you can find native speakers that are learning your native language!, So you can try to talk to them and agree on a language exchange!

## Vocabulary


To practice your Vocabulary, I would recommend an application called [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), it's an app where you can create flashcards of vocabulary that will appear on your lessons, and you need to mark them if you remember the meaning of it. you can add Images, Audio, and install different plugins to extend the number of features availables, you could even use Python to create your own plugin!

This application is also used in different fields, I've heard that meds students also use it to remember different things, so don't hesitate to create different strategies according to your preferences. 

It's a bit difficult to understand at first because it has an outdated UI, so you might need to look for online tutorials to set up your own deck, but it's very worth, you can even share your decks with your other devices.
