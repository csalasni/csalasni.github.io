Taking the best elements from the previous games in the Xeno Saga, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 offers a great plot, 
amazing characters, good improvements in the battle system, and some of the most emotional moments I've experienced in video games.

The story takes place in Aionios, a world where the inhabitants of two nations—Keves and Agnus—live perpetually at war 
and only have a 10-year life expectancy. Because they have flame clocks, which represent each person's life energy, 
they are compelled to steal the enemies' life energies in order to survive that long.

*Fighting in order to live... and living to fight. That's the way of our world.*

## Characters ##

Since the characters make up the core of the Xenoblade games, 
I must go into detail about them in order to talk about this aspect of the game, 
especially in this one since the story has a darker tone than in previous games 
and is more concerned with sentimental and philosophical issues as well as the effects of the never-ending cycle of war, 
particularly on people whose lives revolve around it.

We will take on the roles of Noah, Lanz, and Eunie from the nation of Keves and Mio, Taion, and Sena from the nation of Agnus. 
All of them have sufficient protagonism and character development as the story progresses.
It's also important to point that all of them are going to be available to use in battles 
and that you can freely switch to any of them in the middle of a fight. 
Each character in this game has the ability to fuse with another to control an Ouroboros, 
a form a bit similar to a mech, allowing you to temporarily switch into these powerful forms in the middle of combat 
to employ their skills to deliver a significant amount of damage to your foes 
and also being invulnerable to damage for a small span of time, 
after that, they are going to be separated again.

However it also functions as a story device. When the characters obtains the power of Ouroboros, they shared 
their memories, and prior experices to their fellow, realizing that all of them have traumas, 
and each and their friends have suffered a lot because of the cycle of war, 
and after a few sequentials of events, they realized that now, they share 
a common destiny, even if they were enemies before.


Another important point is that Noah and Mio are offseers which means 
they have the duty to play flutes to send off the spirits of those who have died in the battle between Keves and Agnus, 
therefore the flutes are of the most core parts of the game, 
the soundtrack is heavily inspired by flutes tones, and the characters will sometimes need fulfill their duties after combats.

Even the developers went so far to create custom flutes in the real world, 
Mitsuda-san said, "By making the flutes from scratch, you can create a sound that hasn't been heard before."

## Gameplay ##

The battle system is a mix of Xenoblade 1 and Xenoblade 2 but it has been expanded with the class system, 
each character has their own class but you can assign different character classes, for example, 
Eunie by default is a healer but you can assign her a fighter class if you want her to do the damage in battles, 
As a result, you can create your own classes combinations, and improve the level of the class of each character
to gain new skills and combine with skills of other classes.

Another new feature is the Hero system, It consists of side characters that you can recruit and use as an extra character in battles, 
but you cannot control them (the IA does). These characters supports the team, 
and you can also give the protagonists the classes of the heroes.

The Chain attack is another fighting mechanic. When charged, it can be used to launch a planned assault.
During this time, the enemy won't be able to attack you but you can use combinations based 
on the character classes you are using, giving you an opportunity to turn a tough fight to your favor.

## Conclusion

Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is a fantastic game that significantly improves upon the previous 
installment of the franchise thanks to the Class system, side quests, graphics, 
resolution in Switch controlled mode, and other areas.
There are a lot of side content available in this game, and things to discover as you progress 
in your journey on Aionios, and following the precedents of Xenoblade 2 Torna and 1 DE, 
there is going to be a DLC with the size of an entire game in 2023.

it's not a perfect game because of some flaws, and other small problems attributed to the Switch's Hardware 
but Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is a love letter to the JRPG's fans and a great game for the amazing Switch's Catalogue.
