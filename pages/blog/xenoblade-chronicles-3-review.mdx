Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is one of the best JRPG on the Nintendo Switch, taking the best elements from the previous games of the Xeno Saga
it offers a great plot, amazing characters, good improvement in the battle system, and some of the most emotional moments
that I experienced in video games.

The plot takes place in Aionios, a world where the people of two nations -Keves and Agnus- live perpetually in war, they only have a lifespan of 10 years, and in order to live that extent of time, they need to take life from the other nation, because they have flame clocks, that represent the life energy of each individual, therefore they are forced to steal the life force from the enemies.

*Fighting in order to live... and living to fight. That's the way of our world.*

## Characters ##

In order to talk about this Xenoblade game, I need to detail about the characters, because they are the core part of the game.

We will play as Noah, Lanz, and Eunie from Keves, and Mio, Taion, and Sena from Agnus,  in this game all of them have enough protagonism and character growth as the plot goes on, therefore you will also be able to use the 6 members in the battles, and you'll also be able to switch freely in the middle of the battle to any of them that you want to control.

The core mechanic of this game is that each character can fusion with another to control an Ouroboros, which is like a mecha similar to one of their previous games from PS1, Xenogears, you can use the Ouroboros forms for a small span of time in the middle of battles to deal a great amount of damage to the enemies using their skills.

But is also used as a plot device, because when the characters are merged, they share their memories and past experiences, and thanks to that the characters start to realize that all of them are very similar, they have friends, traumas, hobbies, etc. So we can experience the war from each character's perspective.

Another important point is that Noah and Mio are offseers so they have the duty to play flutes to send off the spirits of those who have died in the battle between Keves and Agnus, therefore the flutes are of the most important things in the world-building, the soundtrack of the game includes flutes tones, and sometimes the characters will need to serve their duties after combats.
Even the developers went so far that they made custom flutes in the real world, Mitsuda-san said, "By making the flutes from scratch, you can create a sound that hasn't been heard before." [Nintendo Interview](https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-6-xenoblade-chronicles-3-part-2/ "Nintendo Interview")

For these reasons, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is a love letter to the JRPG's fans, and a near-perfect game.
